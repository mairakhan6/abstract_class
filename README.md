# abstract_class

Define a class NumInterface whose only role is to provide a common interface (member function prototypes) for the derived classes. It should provide the functions: display(), increment(). You'll guess the full prototype of each function by what you think would be their functionality in the derived classes. In this abstract class the function bodies would be empty.
There is no point to store any data since we do not know what kind of number we are dealing with. You should make it an abstract class, i.e., it should be impossible to create its object.
Define your class such that the first line in main(), on compilation, produces the error as described in the comments. Once you have successfully produced the compile error, comment that line to pass the test case.
